## Introduction

Since 2010, Melburne housing market was experiencing a housing bubble and some expert said it might burst soon.  However, there was a cooling period in 2018. The contributor of the housing market data set was considering buying an apartment. He was seeking data experts to help him draw some insights on the data to assist his decision making.

In Capstone Project, my goal is to explore and understand the relation between the final sold price and different variable factors, perform Predictive Analytics using various machine learning algorithms, compare the performances and differences among these models and find the best model for property price prediction. The procedures I will be following are exploratory analysis, date cleaning, feature engineering, model building and model evaluation.

## Literature Review

After reviewing books, website, journals and video, I found some methodologies and techniques are especially helpful in data visualization and preparation, feature selection & modelling building, and model performance evaluation.

EDA (exploratory data cleaning) is a very important step when conducting initial analyse, De Jonge & Van Der Loo’s book (2013) detail various data preprocessing techniques including missing value handling, data conversion and data manipulation. They also give examples in R environment. They suggested various way to impute missing value such as hot-deck imputation and knn imputation. The book ‘Hands-on exploratory data analysis with R’(Datar & Garg, 2019) not only demonstrates practical data manipulation process using different R packages but also dedicated a big portion in data visualizing utilizing ggplot2 package which makes the data much more easily to be understood. For example, in scatter plot and density plot, colors are used as a new dimension to differentiate categories.

The dataset provides GPS location information for each house. It would be especially helpful to visualize the houses on the map and to color these points by different properties to understand the geographic impact on the houses. The book ggmap: Spatial visualization with ggplot2(Kahle & Wickham, 2013) showed the step by step approach to import map from google map and plot those points in a meaningful way.

In terms of feature selection and modeling building, An introduction to statistical learning: With applications in R (James et al. 2013) has a comprehensive coverage on all the popular algorithms and their mathematical explanations. For each algorithm, it has multiple lab exercise in R environment dedicated to it so you can apply the theory to real dataset. In the section of linear model selection, it provided multiple ways to select the best features of the dataset. I learned Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine and their application in this book.  The elements of statistical learning: Data mining, inference, and prediction (Hastie et al., 2009) gives an in-depth math and statistical concepts on modelling and model evaluations. Due to its missing of application in R environment, I used this book as a supplement reading to the previous modelling book for the concepts that I am not so clear about.


## Dataset

The dataset I am using was posted on Kaggle and scraped by the contributor Pino(2018) from an Australian property website (Domain.com.au) for the period from 2016 to 2018. The data set contains the propterty information of has 34857 observations. Each observation has 21 attributes.
Price is the attribute I am building model to predict. Below provides the summary for the data and visualizaiton of missing values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(visdat)
library(gridExtra)
theme_set(theme_bw())
options(scipen=999)
house=read.csv('data/Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv')
missing=sapply(house,function(x){sum(is.na(x))})
missing=as.data.frame(missing,row.names = NULL)
missing$var=colnames(house)
missing$missing=missing$missing*100/nrow(house)
missing=missing[order(missing$missing),]
ggplot(missing)+geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(var, missing),y=missing),
                         stat = "identity", fill='grey',color='black')+
        coord_flip()+
        labs(title='attributes and their missing value percentage', y='Missing Value Percentage',x='')
vis_miss(house)
```

#### *Attributes explanation and selection*


#### Lattitude & Longtitude 

"Lattitude" & "Longtitude" are the GPS location data. 23% of the data are missing. Below we can visualize the location of the properties on google map and see which area has the high density of the property.
```{r}
register_google(key = "AIzaSyCyjfy52N-yvo76okcOhh4sc1wSqSMi8oI", write = TRUE)
map=get_map(location='Melbourne',zoom = 10,maptype = "terrain",color = "bw",)
ggmap(map)+geom_point(data = house, aes(x = house$Longtitude, y = house$Lattitude), 
                 color ='red', size = 0.05,alpha=0.15)

```

#### BuildingArea & Landsize

"Landsize" is the size of the land the property occupies. "BuildingArea" is the floor square meters of the house, town house or unit. For unit or townhouse, landsize could be very big but the building area might be small as the land are shared by many units or townhouses. 

```{r}
plot1=ggplot(house)+geom_histogram(aes(x=house$Landsize),binwidth = 20,
                             fill='grey',col='black')+
        coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,900))+
        labs(x='landsize')
plot2=ggplot(house)+geom_histogram(aes(x=house$BuildingArea),binwidth = 20,
                             fill='grey',col='black')+
        coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,700))+
        labs(x='building area')

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)

```

#### Price & PricePerSquareMeters

"Price" is the sold price in Australian dollar for the property. Instead of using total price as the predictor, I created a feature "PricePerSquareMeters" to represent price per square meter as it's also the common measure of property value and easier to understand its interaction with the features. Accordingly we will remove the data points having missing value in price and building area, and remove the outliers based on box plot. After the cleaning, total number of observations reduces to 10395. Below shows the missing value after cleaning and price per square meter distribution.


```{r}
#remove missing values
house=house[!is.na(house$Price),]
house=house[house$Price!=0,]
house=house[!is.na(house$BuildingArea),]
house=house[house$BuildingArea!=0,]
house$PriceSQM=house$Price/house$BuildingArea
#remove the outliers
house=house[house$PriceSQM<20000 & house$PriceSQM>30,]
vis_miss(house)
ggplot(house)+geom_histogram(aes(x=house$PriceSQM),
                 binwidth = 600, fill='grey', col='black')+
        labs(x='price per square meter')+
        coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,20000),)

```


#### Suburb, Postcode, Regionname, CouncilArea

"Suburb", "Postcode", "Regionname", "CouncilArea" divide Melbourne into different sections. Below we can find Suburb has the finest divisions (351) whereas regionname only has 9 divisions.

```{r}
Suburb=nrow(table(house$Suburb))
RegionName=nrow(table(house$Regionname))
CouncilArea=nrow(table(house$CouncilArea))
PostalCode=nrow(table(house$Postcode))
Division=data.frame(a=c('Suburb',"RegionName",'CouncilArea','PostalCode'),
                    b=c(Suburb,RegionName,CouncilArea,PostalCode))
ggplot(Division)+geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(a, b),y=b),
                         stat = "identity", fill='grey',col='black', width=0.6)+
        coord_flip()+
        labs(y='Number of Cateories',x='')


```

This map shows the boundaries of Suburb, Postal Code, Council and Region.

![](./map/map.png)

Below is the price per square meter distribution for different regions. Quite obvious, southern metropolitan is more expensive. The red the points on the map are these properties in Southern Metropolitan.

```{r}
ggplot(house)+geom_density(aes(PriceSQM,fill=house$Regionname),alpha=0.4)+
        labs(x='price per square meter')

southern=house[house$Regionname=='Southern Metropolitan',]
ggmap(map)+geom_point(data = southern, aes(x = Longtitude, y = Lattitude), 
                 color ='red', size = 0.05,alpha=0.15)

```

#### Propertycount

"Propertycount" is number of properties that exist in the suburb where the property is located. We can see most properties are in a suburb which has less than 50 properties in its suburb.

```{r}
df_pcount=data.frame(table(house$Propertycount,useNA = 'always'))
ggplot(df_pcount)+geom_histogram(aes(x=df_pcount$Freq),binwidth = 30, 
                                 fill='grey', col='black')+
        labs(x='number of properties in its suburb')
```

#### address

Each property has its own address. It would not be included in the model as we already have Suburb, Postcode, Regionname, CouncilArea as geographical features.

#### Type

There are three types of houses.

"House" reprents house,cottage,villa, semi,terrace.

"Unit" reprents apartment, condo, duplex.

"Townhouse" repsents townhouse only.

Below we could see the total number of each type and the average price per square meter distribution.

```{r}
house$Type=as.character(house$Type)
house[house$Type=='u',]$Type='unit'
house[house$Type=='h',]$Type='house'
house[house$Type=='t',]$Type='townhouse'
house$Type=as.factor(house$Type)
ggplot(house)+geom_bar(aes(x=house$Type),fill='grey',width = 0.3,col='black')+
        labs(x='house type')
ggplot(house)+geom_density(aes(house$PriceSQM,fill=house$Type),alpha=0.4)+
        labs(x='price per square meter')

```


#### Rooms, bedroom2

"Rooms" and "bedroom2" are very similar, which is the number of bedrooms in the property. "Rooms" has no missing value and "bedroom2" has 23% percent missing value and is scraped by the contributor from different sources. "bedroom2" would be discarded in the model.

```{r}
ggplot(house)+geom_bar(aes(x=house$Rooms), fill='grey',col='black')+
        coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,16),)+ 
        scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 16, 1))+
        labs(x='Number of Room')
```        

#### bathroom

"bathroom" is the number of bathroom. 24% of the data is missing. Below we can find "bathroom" and "rooms" are correlated.

```{r}
pb1=ggplot(house)+geom_bar(aes(x=house$Bathroom), fill='grey',col='black')+
        coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,16),)+ 
        scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 16, 1))+
        labs(x='Number of bathroom')

pb2=ggplot(house)+geom_point(aes(x=house$Rooms,y=house$Bathroom))+
        labs(x='number of room', y='number of bathroom')

grid.arrange(pb1, pb2, ncol=2)
print(cor.test(house$Rooms,house$Bathroom))
```

#### car

"car" is the number of parking spots each property has. The bar chart shows the distribution.

```{r}

ggplot(house)+geom_histogram(aes(x=house$Car),
                        col='black',fill='grey')+
        coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,10),)+
        scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 10, 1))+
        labs(x='number of parking spot',
             y='number of properties')

```

#### Distance

"Distance" is the distance in km from the property to the center business district.

```{r}
house$Distance=as.character(house$Distance)
house$Distance=as.numeric(house$Distance)
ggplot(house)+geom_histogram(aes(x=house$Distance), 
                             fill='grey',col='black',binwidth = 2)+
        labs(x='Distance to CBD in km', y='number of properties')
```

#### yearbuilt

The year the property is built. I group years to diffent categories to visualize the data. The categories are "<1900", "1900~1949", "1950~1979", "1980~1999",'2000~2010'. 'yearbuilt' has some missing values.

```{r}
df_year=as.data.frame(table(house$YearBuilt, useNA ='always'))
colnames(df_year)=c('year','count')
df_year$year=as.numeric(as.character(df_year$year))
df_year$year50 <- cut(df_year$year, c(0, 1899,1949,1979,1999,2050),
                      include.lowest = T,
                      right = TRUE)
levels(df_year$year50) <- c("<1900", "1900~1949", "1950~1979", "1980~1999",'2000~2010')
ggplot(df_year)+geom_bar(aes(x=df_year$year50, y=df_year$count),
                         stat = "identity",
                         fill='black', width = 0.5)+
        labs(title="Histogram for year built", x='year',
             y='number of properties')+
        coord_flip()
```

#### date

"date" is the date the property was sold. The plot shows the average price per squar meter per month.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
df_num=data.frame(table(house$Date))
colnames(df_num)=c('Date','count')
df_num$Date=dmy(df_num$Date)
df_num$Date=floor_date(df_num$Date, unit = "month")
df_num=aggregate(df_num$count~df_num$Date,df_num,sum)
df_num=df_num[c(-1,-2),]
pd1= ggplot(df_num)+geom_line(aes(x=df_num$`df_num$Date`,y=df_num$`df_num$count`),
                                   color="grey")+
        geom_point(aes(x=df_num$`df_num$Date`,y=df_num$`df_num$count`),
                                                          color="black")+
        labs(title='Property sold per month',x='date', y='number of properties sold ')


df_avghouseprice=aggregate(house$PriceSQM~house$Date,house,mean)
colnames(df_avghouseprice)=c('Date','average sold price')
df_avghouseprice$Date=dmy(df_avghouseprice$Date)
df_avghouseprice$Date=floor_date(df_avghouseprice$Date, unit = "month")
df_avghouseprice=aggregate(df_avghouseprice$`average sold price`~df_avghouseprice$Date,
                           df_avghouseprice,mean)
df_avghouseprice=df_avghouseprice[-1,]
colnames(df_avghouseprice)=c('Date','average sold price')
pd2= ggplot(df_avghouseprice)+geom_line(aes(x=df_avghouseprice$Date,y=df_avghouseprice$`average sold price`),
                                   color="grey")+
        geom_point(aes(x=df_avghouseprice$Date,y=df_avghouseprice$`average sold price`),
                  color="black")+
        labs(title='average sold price per month',x='date', y='average sold price per square meter')
grid.arrange(pd1, pd2, ncol=2)
```


#### method

"method" reflects how the house was sold. Below are the meanings of different method and the distribution chart.

PI - property passed in; 

S - sold not disclosed; 

SA - sold after auction; 

SP - property sold prior; 

VB - vendor bid

```{r}
ggplot(house)+geom_bar(aes(x=house$Method), fill='grey', col='black',
              width = 0.5)+
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30,vjust = 0.5))+
        labs(x='method')

```



## Approach

![](./map/approach.png)

#### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Explore and visualize each attribute and its relation to the prediction variable; Perform data cleaning and feature engineering to find or create the best the relevant features to feed into the model;

#### Step 2: Model Building & Tuning

Build models using various algorithms; Fine tuning parameters to achieve best performance for each algorithm; Adjust features if needed;

#### Step 3: Model Evaluation

Perform cross-validation to compare performance across different models and decide on the final model.
