## Introduction

Since 2010, Melburne housing market was experiencing a housing bubble and some expert said it might burst soon.  However, there was a cooling period in 2018. The contributor of the housing market dataset was considering buying an apartment. He was seeking data experts to help him draw some insights on the data to assist his decision making.

In Capstone Project, my goal is to explore and understand the relation between the final sold price and different variable factors, perform Predictive Analytics using various machine learning algorithms, compare the performances and differences among these models and find the best model for property price prediction.
